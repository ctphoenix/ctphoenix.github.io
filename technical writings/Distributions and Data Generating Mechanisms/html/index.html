          <h1>Distributions and Data Generating Mechanisms</h1>
          
          <div class="math-content">
            <p>When we say a random variable <span
            class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has some distribution, that
            means we have specified a function that tells us how likely
            each outcome is. This function must sum (or integrate) to 1
            over all possible values.</p>
            <p>We can view this function as having two parts: <span
            class="math display">\[\text{Distribution} =
            \underbrace{\text{Kernel}}_{\text{function of} x}
            \times
            \underbrace{\text{normalizing constant}}_{\text{ensures prob} 1}.\]</span> The <em>kernel</em> is
            simply the piece of the function that depends on the
            variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. If this
            kernel integrates / sums to a finite number, we can divide
            the kernel by this number to multiply by the appropriate
            constant so that the total area (or sum) is 1. So any
            function whose integral is finite <em>can</em> be turned
            into a probability distribution by dividing by that
            integral.</p>
            <p>In the examples below, we will sometimes write <span
            class="math inline">\(\displaystyle p(x) \propto
            f(x)\)</span> to indicate "<span
            class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is proportional to <span
            class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, and the rest of the
            constant is chosen to make things sum or integrate to
            1."</p>
            <p>We will start with the simplest distributions and then
            build up to slightly more complex ones, showing how certain
            distributions arise naturally from data generating
            mechanisms. We will also highlight how some distributions
            are related to each other (for instance, how summing certain
            random variables leads to another known distribution).</p>

            Bernoulli Distribution</h1>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel">Kernel</h3>
            <p>The Bernoulli distribution takes values <span
            class="math inline">\(x \in \{0, 1\}\)</span>. We can write
            its pmf (probability mass function) as: <span
            class="math display">\[p(x) = p^x (1-p)^{1-x},\]</span>
            where <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; p &lt;
            1\)</span>.</p>
            <p>This particular distribution doesn't have an normalizing
            constant: because <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
            either 0 or 1, we can see that this function is either <span
            class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (when <span
            class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>) or <span
            class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span> (when <span
            class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>), and <span
            class="math inline">\(p(0) + p(1) = 1\)</span>.</p>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="intuitive-explanation">Intuitive
            Explanation</h3>
            <p>A Bernoulli random variable represents a single trial
            with two possible outcomes (often called "success" and
            "failure"), with probability <span
            class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of success. You might think
            of tossing a possibly biased coin. The pmf reflects that if
            <span class="math inline">\(X=1\)</span> (success), we get
            factor <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and if <span
            class="math inline">\(X=0\)</span> (failure), we get factor
            <span class="math inline">\((1-p)\)</span>.</p>

            Binomial Distribution</h1>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel-1">Kernel</h3>
            <p>A Binomial random variable <span class="math inline">\(X
            \in \{0,1,\ldots,n\}\)</span> can be viewed as the sum of
            <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> independent
            Bernoulli(<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) trials.
            Its pmf is: <span class="math display">\[p(x) =
            \binom{n}{x}\, p^x (1-p)^{n-x},
            \quad x = 0,1,\ldots,n.\]</span> If we strip out the
            binomial coefficient (and ignore that it depends on <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span>), the kernel is <span
            class="math display">\[\text{Kernel} \;=\; p^x
            (1-p)^{n-x}.\]</span> The factor <span
            class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{x}\)</span> is also part of
            the pmf, but you can think of it as arising from the need to
            count all ways to arrange the <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span> successes among <span
            class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials. The overall
            normalizing constant ensures the pmf sums to 1 over <span
            class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> to <span
            class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
            <h3 class="unnumbered"
            id="intuitive-explanation-1">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>If we flip a (possibly biased) coin <span
            class="math inline">\(n\)</span> times, the Binomial(<span
            class="math inline">\(n,p\)</span>) distribution describes
            the number of heads. The form <span
            class="math inline">\(p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\)</span> is the kernel
            from the Bernoulli story, but raised to reflect <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span> successes and <span
            class="math inline">\(n-x\)</span> failures, times a
            combinatorial factor counting how many distinct ways those
            outcomes can appear.</p>
            <h1 class="unnumbered" id="geometric-distribution">3.
            Geometric Distribution</h1>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel-2">Kernel</h3>
            <p>For the Geometric distribution (in one convention) <span
            class="math inline">\(X \in \{1,2,3,\ldots\}\)</span> is the
            trial index of the <em>first</em> success in a sequence of
            Bernoulli(<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) trials.
            Its pmf is: <span class="math display">\[p(x) = (1-p)^{x-1}
            p, \quad x = 1,2,3,\ldots\]</span> The kernel (up to a
            constant) is: <span class="math display">\[\text{Kernel}
            \;=\; (1-p)^{x-1}.\]</span></p>
            <h3 class="unnumbered"
            id="intuitive-explanation-2">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>We keep flipping a coin (with success probability <span
            class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) until the first success.
            The chance that the first success is on the <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-th flip requires that the
            first <span class="math inline">\((x-1)\)</span> flips were
            failures (each with probability <span
            class="math inline">\((1-p)\)</span>), and then the <span
            class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-th is a success (with
            probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>). Summing
            over all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from 1 to
            <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> and requiring
            this sum to be 1 leads to the pmf having the factor <span
            class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in front (the normalizing
            constant in that sense).</p>
            <h1 class="unnumbered"
            id="negative-binomial-distribution">4. Negative Binomial
            Distribution</h1>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel-3">Kernel</h3>
            <p>A Negative Binomial random variable <span
            class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be seen as the number
            of <em>failures</em> before the <span
            class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-th success (or the trial of
            the <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>-th success,
            depending on convention). One standard pmf form is: <span
            class="math display">\[p(x) = \binom{x + r - 1}{x} (1-p)^x\,
            p^r,
            \quad x = 0,1,2,\ldots\]</span> The kernel is similar to the
            geometric, but the choose function out front ensures all the
            ways you can succeed <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
            times up to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
            <h3 class="unnumbered"
            id="intuitive-explanation-3">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>This is the generalization of the geometric story to the
            case where we continue flipping a coin and count the number
            of failures before we have accumulated <span
            class="math inline">\(r\)</span> successes. Hence, its
            kernel has the same <span
            class="math inline">\((1-p)^{x}\)</span> flavor, but
            reflects waiting for multiple successes.</p>
            <h1 class="unnumbered" id="poisson-distribution">5. Poisson
            Distribution</h1>
            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel-4">Kernel</h3>
            <p>The Poisson distribution takes values <span
            class="math inline">\(x \in \{0,1,2,\ldots\}\)</span> with
            pmf <span class="math display">\[p(x) =
            \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}\, e^{-\lambda}.\]</span> The kernel, up
            to a constant, is <span class="math display">\[\text{Kernel}
            \;=\; \frac{\lambda^x}{x!}.\]</span></p>
            <h3 class="unnumbered"
            id="intuitive-explanation-4">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>The Poisson often describes the number of events (say,
            fish sightings in a river) that occur within a fixed time
            interval, given that each instant has a fixed "instantaneous
            probability" (sometimes called a hazard rate) of an event.
            If events happen independently at a constant average rate
            <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, then the count
            in one unit of time follows a Poisson(<span
            class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) distribution.</p>
            <p>It also has a nice property: <em>the sum of two
            independent Poisson random variables, with rates <span
            class="math inline">\(\lambda_1\)</span> and <span
            class="math inline">\(\lambda_2\)</span>, is Poisson with
            rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 +
            \lambda_2\)</span>.</em> This makes sense if you imagine two
            independent "streams" of events. Combining them simply
            creates one Poisson process with a higher total rate <span
            class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2\)</span>.</p>

            <h3 class="unnumbered" id="kernel-5">Kernel</h3>
            <p>Moving to continuous distributions, let <span
            class="math inline">\(X \ge 0\)</span>. Then an
            Exponential(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>)
            random variable has pdf <span class="math display">\[f(x) =
            \lambda\, e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \ge 0.\]</span> The kernel
            is <span class="math display">\[\text{Kernel} \;=\;

            <h3 class="unnumbered"
            id="intuitive-explanation-5">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>Imagine events happening one by one in a Poisson process
            with rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. The
            waiting time until the <em>first event</em> is
            Exponential(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>).
            In other words, there's a fixed instantaneous hazard rate
            <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> at any
            moment.</p>
            <p>This distribution is a continuous analog to the geometric
            distribution: the probability of seeing the first event in a
            tiny interval is <span class="math inline">\(\lambda \times
            \text{(length of interval)}\)</span>, and no memory is
            retained if it doesn't happen. When you integrate the kernel
            <span class="math inline">\(e^{-\lambda x}\)</span> from
            <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
            class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, you get <span
            class="math inline">\(1/\lambda\)</span>, so the factor
            <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> out in front is
            the normalizing constant.</p>

            id="intuitive-explanation-6">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
            <p>Like how the Negative Binomial distribution arises from
            waiting for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> successes
            with a certain geometric structure, the Gamma distribution
            describes the waiting time until the <span
            class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-th event in a Poisson
            process, <em>when <span
            class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a positive
            integer</em>. That is, the sum of <span

            <em>continuous generalization</em> of that same idea. The
            factor <span class="math inline">\(x^{\alpha-1}\)</span> in
            the kernel arises naturally from the process of summing
            multiple exponential waiting times (the "shape" <span

            many exponentials you're summing).</p>

            <p>Don't let that form scare you: it's the exponential of a

            <p>The Normal(<span

            commonly arises as a sum of many small independent effects
            (by the Central Limit Theorem). For example, if you sum up a
            large number of independent random variables with finite
            mean and variance, in many cases the distribution of that
            sum (properly scaled) approaches a Normal distribution. Its
            exponential form in the kernel reflects how, in the
